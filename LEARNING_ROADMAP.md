## Portfolio flow

`React → Node API → FastAPI → translate/extract → embedding + Atlas Vector Search → reuse or RAG → LLM → translate → React`

Each stage is intentionally separate, so you can explain its responsibility, data, and evaluation method in interviews.

## LangChain

The four named patterns are demonstrated without changing the app's response contract
or behavior — this was a portfolio/interview-value swap of internals, not a feature.

- **Document loaders**: `scripts/ingest_document.py` loads source files via
  `langchain_community.document_loaders.TextLoader` instead of a raw `Path.read_text()`.
  (`langchain-community` carries a "being sunset" deprecation notice upstream but still
  works and is the pattern most tutorials/interviews reference — noted here so it isn't
  a surprise later.)
- **Chunking**: the hand-rolled token-window splitter (`app/chunking.py`, now deleted)
  was replaced with `langchain_text_splitters.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
  .from_tiktoken_encoder(...)`, same `chunk_size=300, chunk_overlap=50` defaults.
- **Retrievers**: `agri-assistant-ai/app/retrievers.py` defines `AtlasVectorRetriever`,
  a custom `langchain_core.retrievers.BaseRetriever` subclass wrapping the app's
  existing async MongoDB `$vectorSearch` aggregation. **Deliberately not using**
  `langchain-mongodb`'s prebuilt `MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch`: it only supports a
  synchronous `pymongo.Collection` (no working async-native support), which would have
  required a second, separate sync Mongo connection alongside the app's existing
  `AsyncMongoClient`. `semantic_search.py` and `rag.py` now build an
  `AtlasVectorRetriever` internally but keep their original function signatures and
  return types — no callers changed.
- **Prompt templates**: `langchain_core.prompts.PromptTemplate` builds the text for the
  extraction input, the RAG generation prompt, and the translate-back instructions in
  `workflow.py`/`rag.py`. The actual model calls are still `AsyncOpenAI().responses
  .create(...)` with strict `json_schema` structured outputs — deliberately not switched
  to `langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI`, since that call pattern was only just tuned to fix
  an intent-classification reliability bug and isn't worth re-risking.
- **Embeddings**: `langchain_openai.OpenAIEmbeddings` (async `aembed_query`/
  `aembed_documents`) replaced the manual `client.embeddings.create(...)` calls
  everywhere embeddings are generated (retrievers, both ingestion scripts).

**Dependency note:** `langchain-openai` requires `openai>=1.109.1` — bumped from the
previously pinned `openai==1.99.9` (both are pre-2.0 releases; the `openai` 2.x line
requires `langchain-openai>=1.2`, which was avoided specifically to not risk the tuned
`responses.create`/structured-output call sites on a major SDK version).

## MCP

`agri-assistant-ai/mcp_server.py` is a standalone MCP server (official `mcp` SDK,
pinned `mcp<2` for the stable v1 line — a `2.0` line is still alpha and renames
`FastMCP`→`MCPServer`) that exposes exactly the two tools named in this roadmap row:
`get_weather_forecast(location)` and `get_crop_price(crop, location)`. It reuses
`app/weather.py`/`app/crop_price.py` directly — no logic duplicated — via
`format_forecast`/`format_price` helper functions that were extracted out of
`workflow.py`'s private formatting code so both entrypoints share them.

**Deliberately a separate process, not mounted into the FastAPI app.** The MCP Python
SDK's ASGI-mount path had real, currently-open upstream bugs (redirect loops,
session-init errors) as of 2026-07. Running standalone via `mcp.run(transport="stdio")`
is the reliable path, and is also exactly how Claude Desktop/Claude Code spawn local
MCP servers — no port to configure.

**Deliberately not wired into the LangGraph workflow as a tool-calling client**, even
after the "Agents" row below shipped. `app/agent.py` calls `weather.py`/`crop_price.py`'s
plain Python functions directly, the same way `mcp_server.py` does — the two
entrypoints share the underlying functions, not a protocol connection between them.
Routing the *internal* agent through its own MCP server would add a protocol hop and
new failure modes for no benefit; MCP's job here is external exposure only.

## Agents

Tool selection is no longer a hand-coded classification step. `app/agent.py`'s
`run_agent(question_english, crop, location)` gives the model three tools via OpenAI's
native Responses API function-calling and lets it decide which to call — none, one, or
several — instead of us extracting an `intent` field and branching on it:

- `get_weather_forecast(location)` → `weather.fetch_weather_forecast` + `format_forecast`
- `get_crop_price(crop, location)` → `crop_price.fetch_crop_price` + `format_price`
- `search_documents(query)` → `rag.find_relevant_chunks` (same threshold-filtered
  retrieval RAG already used)

The loop: call the model with `tools=[...]` → for each `function_call` item in
`response.output`, execute the real Python function → continue with
`client.responses.create(..., previous_response_id=response.id, input=[{"type":
"function_call_output", ...}], tools=[...])` → repeat (capped at 4 rounds) until the
model stops calling tools. `previous_response_id` handles conversation/reasoning
continuity server-side, so prior turns don't need to be replayed manually.

**Grounding is enforced in code, not just prompted.** The agent's system instructions
say to only state facts backed by a tool result, but that alone isn't a guarantee — so
`run_agent` tracks which tools actually returned real data (a forecast, a price, or any
document chunks) and derives `source` from that (`"weather-forecast"` /
`"price-lookup"` / `"rag-generated"`, reusing the exact same `ChatResponse` literal
values as before — no schema change). If no tool produced anything usable, the model's
own text is discarded entirely and `workflow.py`'s `_agent` node falls back to the exact
same plain status message the old `status_message` node used
(`source: "translation-extraction"`) — the app never presents ungrounded, hallucinated
agricultural advice as if it were sourced.

Verified-answer reuse (`semantic_search.py`) stays a **deterministic pre-check before
the agent runs**, not a tool — expert-reviewed content should be authoritative when it
matches crop+location, not left to model discretion.

This simplified `workflow.py`'s graph from 4 conditional branches (weather/price/RAG/
status, each hand-routed from a classified `intent`) down to 2 (verified-answer match,
then the agent) while being strictly more capable — the agent can combine tools within
a single answer (e.g. weather + irrigation advice) instead of being locked into exactly
one branch per question. One accepted limitation: `ChatResponse.source` is still a
single value, so if multiple tools contribute to one answer, only one "wins" for
attribution (weather > price > rag priority) — a pre-existing schema constraint, not
something this change needed to fix.

## Tool calling

The weather and mandi price lookups themselves (used by both the agent above and the
standalone MCP server) are plain async functions with no LLM involved in the lookup
itself:

1. **Weather forecast** — `agri-assistant-ai/app/weather.py` geocodes a location and
   fetches a 5-day forecast from Open-Meteo (no API key needed).
2. **Mandi price** — `agri-assistant-ai/app/crop_price.py` looks up the latest modal
   price for a crop via the data.gov.in Agmarknet API (resource
   `9ef84268-d588-465a-a308-a864a43d0070`), trying the location as a district, then a
   state, then falling back to a nationwide lookup. Requires `DATA_GOV_IN_API_KEY` in
   `agri-assistant-ai/.env` (already set locally, gitignored; placeholder in
   `.env.example`).
   **Implementation note:** this API's server hangs indefinitely on Python's
   OpenSSL-based TLS handshake (reproduced with both `httpx` and stdlib `urllib`) while
   `curl.exe`'s Schannel TLS stack connects in under a second, so `crop_price.py` shells
   out to `curl` (present by default on Windows and Git for Windows) instead of using
   `httpx` like the other tools.
